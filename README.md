ABSTRACT: The design and discovery of a new drugs, is an expensive and time-consuming process. Because of this, we have recently seen a new labeling strategy by drug manufactures. The process attempts “repositioning” by seeking new applications for already existing drugs. Furthermore, the development of various formulations creates new ingredients from the two previous compounds. The substantial privileges of this strategy are: diminished expenses, reduced time-consumption and the lower risk in design and discovery of drug production . 1 Furthermore, according to the expertise, the substituted drugs have the same efficacy and potency compare to the main ones. Thus recently, recommendation methods based on “Network Base Interference” (NBI) have given out such effective outcomes . 2
In this paper, we present a new method based on “Drug-target interaction network” naming “DT-BEIG” in which the concept of “Eigenvector Centrality” can be used in the repositioning. To be more elaborate to the concept of Eigenvector Centrality, we can say the significance of a node increased dependently to its connectivity to the other nodes with the high value and Eigenvector Centrality is a criterion that demonstrates this concept . 3 Therefore, within this perception, by having the knowledge about a node, we are granted access to more information of other nodes. This can’t be achieved through “Centrality by Degree”; the main reason we employed this concept in Drug-target interaction.
Moreover, the predicted algorithm driven from DT-Hybrid has been introduced by Alaimo . 4 This algorithm is based on the last edition of the DTI data set, which has been tested within the Drug Bank organization. Thus, the predicted algorithm could foresee more reliable drug-target interactions in some of data sets compare to DT-Hybrid algorithm.
In the methods based on NBI, if required, the concept of Centrality by Degree has been yield in order to find the significant nodes. However, in this paper; we have used the concept of Eigenvector Centrality in our calculations in regards to the actual repositioning in Drug-target interaction. Consequently, the preferred method in the paper leads us to witness an increase in precision, reliability and prediction relative to the DT-Hybrid algorithm, which also reduced the deviation from the factual scores. These are the remarkable privileges of this application compared to DT-Hybrid method.
